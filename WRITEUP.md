Intro
=====
stub: describe this challenge
stub: who created it


Implementing the syn virtual machine (Codes 1-4)
================================================
stub: pretty straightforward (had previous experience writing CHIP-8 emulator)


Navigating the maze (Code 5)
============================
stub: went from reverse engineering the binary to writing a map by hand
stub: subtle variations in room description an intentional hint
stub: attention to fine detail a good characteristic for programmers
stub: did by hand in less than 5 minutes
stub: will need to go back and try writing a room mapper


Solving the coin puzzle (Code 6)
================================
stub: again did manually in less than 5 minutes
stub: include a code snippet that solves this (just for fun)


Using the teleporter (Code 7)
=============================
stub: thought I could get by with tracer and hexdump
stub: created a debugger to provide interactivity
stub: created a disassembler to locate where I was in the logic
stub: had seen a hint on reddit mentioning ackermann function
stub: provide definition of verifier function in terms of m, n, and k
stub: tried to come up with a closed form solution by hand
stub: got m = 0, m = 1, and m = 2
stub: using that, optimized the code (crack-better-verifier.c) to use m = 2
      formula, solved in 10 seconds
stub: tried optimizing further, use a loop to calculate m = 3, improved
      solving time to 3 seconds


Conclusion
==========
stub: would like to write a "to syn machine code" compiler (or assembler)
stub: thinking about a connect four game for the syn-vm
stub: look out for more things from this guy (like advent of code)
