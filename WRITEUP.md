Intro
=====
stub: describe this challenge
stub: who created it


Implementing the syn virtual machine (Codes 1-4)
================================================
stub: pretty straightforward (had previous experience writing CHIP-8 emulator)


Navigating the maze (Code 5)
============================
stub: went from reverse engineering the binary to writing a map by hand
stub: subtle variations in room description an intentional hint
stub: attention to fine detail a good characteristic for programmers
stub: did by hand in less than 5 minutes
stub: will need to go back and try writing a room mapper


Solving the coin puzzle (Code 6)
================================
stub: again did manually in less than 5 minutes
stub: include a code snippet that solves this (just for fun)


Conclusion
==========
stub: would like to write a "to syn machine code" compiler
stub: maybe a dsl for creating text adventures also
stub: write a debugger
stub: look out for more things from this guy (like advent of code)
